"""
PARALLEL LLM ANALYSIS WORKFLOW WITH DETAILED EXPLANATION
================================================================
This example demonstrates a true parallel workflow where:
1. Three analysis nodes run in parallel from the START node
2. Each node uses LLM to analyze a different aspect of an essay
3. Each node returns ONLY the state field it updates (not entire state)
4. All results are combined in a finalizer node
5. LangGraph automatically merges all partial state updates

KEY CONCEPT: In LangGraph, when multiple nodes run in parallel, 
each should return a dictionary containing ONLY the state fields 
that it modifies. LangGraph will automatically merge all these
partial updates into the complete state.

# SECTION 2: LLM INITIALIZATION
# =================================================================

"""
Initialize the Language Model (LLM) that will be used for analysis.

Why AzureChatOpenAI?
- Integrates with Azure OpenAI services
- Provides a consistent interface for GPT models
- Handles authentication and API calls automatically

Parameters Explained:
- deployment_name: Which Azure deployment to use
- model_name: Specific GPT model variant
- temperature: Controls randomness (0.1 = very deterministic)
- max_tokens: Maximum response length (100 tokens ≈ 75 words)
- azure_endpoint: URL of Azure OpenAI service
- api_version: Azure API version
- api_key: Authentication key
- azure_deployment: Specific deployment instance

This LLM object will be used by all analysis nodes.
"""
llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    deployment_name="gpt-4.1-mini",
    model_name="gpt-4.1-mini",
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=100,
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),

# =================================================================
# SECTION 3: STATE DEFINITION USING TypedDict
# =================================================================

"""
Define the structure of our workflow state using TypedDict.

Think of the state as a "shared container" that flows through the workflow.
Each node can read from and write to specific parts of this container.

State Fields:
1. essay: The text to analyze (input, never modified)
2. grammar_score: Score from grammar analysis (0-100)
3. sentiment_score: Score from sentiment analysis (0-100)
4. clarity_score: Score from clarity analysis (0-100)
5. final_result: Combined report from finalizer

Why use TypedDict?
- Provides type hints for better code completion
- Documents what data is expected
- Helps catch errors early
- Makes code self-documenting
"""
class ParallelState(TypedDict):
    """State container for parallel essay analysis workflow"""
    essay: str            # Original essay text (input)
    grammar_score: int    # Grammar analysis score (0-100)
    sentiment_score: int  # Sentiment analysis score (0-100)
    clarity_score: int    # Clarity analysis score (0-100)
    final_result: str     # Final combined report

# =================================================================
# SECTION 4: PARALLEL ANALYSIS NODE FUNCTIONS
# =================================================================

"""
IMPORTANT: Each analysis node function follows this pattern:
1. Receives the current state
2. Uses LLM to analyze one specific aspect
3. Returns ONLY the state field it updates (as a dictionary)

This is CRITICAL for parallel execution because:
- Multiple nodes might run simultaneously
- Each should only modify its own part of the state
- LangGraph merges all partial updates automatically

Returning only what you change prevents conflicts and makes the
workflow more robust and maintainable.

KEY CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:

1. TRUE PARALLEL EXECUTION
   - Multiple nodes starting from START simultaneously
   - Each node runs independently
   - LangGraph manages execution and state merging

2. PROPER STATE MANAGEMENT
   - Each node returns ONLY what it updates
   - No conflicts between parallel nodes
   - Clear separation of responsibilities

3. LLM INTEGRATION PATTERNS
   - Structured prompts for consistent outputs
   - Score extraction from LLM responses
   - Chaining multiple LLM calls effectively

4. WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION
   - Parallel nodes → Synchronization point → Final node
   - Clear data flow through state
   - Modular, maintainable architecture

5. REAL-WORLD APPLICATION
   - Automated essay scoring and feedback
   - Parallel analysis for efficiency
   - Comprehensive reporting from multiple inputs

EXTENSION IDEAS FOR WORKSHOP:
1. Add more analysis criteria (vocabulary, structure, originality)
2. Implement weighted scoring (grammar 40%, sentiment 30%, clarity 30%)
3. Add confidence scores for each analysis
4. Create different report formats (executive, detailed, student-friendly)
5. Implement batch processing for multiple essays
6. Add visualization of scores (charts, graphs)
7. Integrate with learning management systems
